# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
The goal of this project is to perform analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover hidden trends that would help Louise maximize the probability of success of her new play, Fever.
By looking at multiple factors, we can apply statistical analysis to give Louise more insight on what areas to focus on, and how to improve her fundraising strategies. Looking at the data, the two most important variables to be considered are the timing of the fundraising launch date, and how high the fundraising goal is set.
